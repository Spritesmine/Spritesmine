Here is Spritesmine, a student from Hebei, China.

Computer content depth enthusiasts, tossing experts, especially interested in computer skills. In my spare time, I like to write code, watch computer content and study computer content. Study for hobbies. I like tossing. My article will be on my [Blog](https://qisansui.cn)(zh-CN).

I want to be an interesting person and create something that can be remembered by others.

Out of self-learning and hobbies, I will open source some small projects on Github. My expectation is to research some interesting project according to my preferences. Welcome to send emails or leave messages to communicate with me.

Everything comes from interest~~~
